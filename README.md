__Caveat__:

If you're currently taking the same course, please refrain yourself from checking out this solution as it will be against Coursera's Honor Code and wonâ€™t do you any good. Plus, once you're worked your heart out and was able to solve a particularly difficult problem, a sense of confidence you gained from such experience is priceless :)

__Assignment Description:__
<br/>
In this scenario, you are working for an e-commerce company that is currently developing a new feature for their website to send reminder emails to users who have items in their shopping carts yet have not completed the purchase. Your task is write queries to perform an AB test and measure the impact of the new feature with regard to two business metrics (1) the number of times the users revisit the items in their shopping cart and (2) the number of items the users ended up ordering within a 30-day window since the day the reminder email was sent out.
